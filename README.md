# UX-HRI-scale
This study aims to develop a specialized evaluation scale for assessing human-robot interaction (HRI) user experience (UX) in manufacturing, addressing the gap in traditional UX evaluations which focus on household products and websites. By integrating robotic technology and human-robot collaboration, companies can achieve smart manufacturing and advance Industry 4.0. We designed a questionnaire based on twelve key themes of HRI UX. Our scale includes "Comprehensive Operational Efficiency" and "Cognitive Usability" subscales, ensuring sustainable health and well-being for workers in manufacturing environments.




If you wish to use our scale, we recommend citing the following paper:
